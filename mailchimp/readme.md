# Sync unsubscribes from Mailchimp to Segment

This is a [Custom Source](https://segment.com/docs/sources/custom/) for Segment, allowing you to sync unsubscribes in Mailchimp to your Segment data pipeline.

The implementation is made to support [Segments Unsubscribe Email Spec](https://segment.com/docs/spec/email/#unsubscribed) with the available data from [Mailchimps Unsubscribe webhook](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/guides/about-webhooks/#unsubscribes).

Read [Segments documentation](https://segment.com/docs/sources/custom/) to setup this Custom Source.
